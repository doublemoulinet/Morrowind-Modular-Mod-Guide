# Gameplay - Consistency
Addresses the various lore and logic inconsistencies with the game, and can be considered the "vanilla-plus" content section of the guide.

## Expansion Integrations
Better integrates the expansion content into the base game. *Early Transport to Mournhold* complements *Expansion Delay*'s changes to the Tribunal quest hook.
