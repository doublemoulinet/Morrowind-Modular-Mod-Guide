# Optional Early Loaders
These optional mods should not be used on your first playthrough. The **Official Plugins** are a real grab bag--some are great, others are trivial, some are best forgotten. The cleaned and fixed versions presented here are the best way to incorporate them into your game, but are not necessary for an enjoyable Morrowind experience. 

The landmass mods--Tamriel Rebuilt and its sister projects--are highly recommended on subsequent playthroughs. These are arguably the most impressive modding projects on the web. Tamriel Rebuilt is a decades-long project to recreate the Morrowind mainland in TES3. The "Old Ebonheart" release is one of the best quest mods available and I recommend a TR-centric playthrough to play the different questlines.

Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince overhauls the Bloodmoon expansion to bring the world design in line with current Tamriel Rebuilt / Project Tamriel design standards. It is highly recommended. You will see why after you play Bloodmoon in vanilla: the vanilla world design is flat, empty, and boring. STOTSP is a performance-friendly overhaul that makes playing Bloodmoon significantly more fun.

**Important**: if you install the Unofficial Plugins and/or Landmass mods move them to the *top of your install order* in the Wrye Mash Installers Tab. This is to ensure neither TR nor the official plugins overwrite your mesh/texture fixes in the [Core](https://github.com/doublemoulinet/Morrowind-Modular-Mod-Guide/blob/master/CORE.md) section
