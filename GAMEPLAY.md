# Gameplay - Expanded
The good stuff. This module introduces the majority of the new and improved gameplay mechanics and features.

## Frameworks
Framework package used by multiple mods. Required.
1. [Skills Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034)

## Player Levelling
Irons out kinks and reduces metagaming in the player levelling system.
1. [Improved Vanilla Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48065?)
1. [Class Skill Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48989)
1. [Magicka Based Skill Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330?)
1. [MWSE Magicka Regen](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48129?)
1. [Personal Effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45338?)
	- Enable only the "Personal Effects_MWSE.ESP"
1. [Proportional Progression](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- In MO2, set Proportional Progression as your data directory and install
1. [Proportional Progression config file](https://mega.nz/file/65IDlIyD#TNWRaOH9-PAilPD1NGH1hCxZzYUoL2OWGrMVstVA1Bk)
	- Enable only "01 - Improved Vanilla"
	- This custom config file enables the levelling scaling of Proportional Progression. Tweaked for **Improved Vanilla levelling** and **Class Skill Limit**.
>The **Proportional Progression** configuration slows player levelling and adjusts skill-rate increases for most skills.

## Skill Tweaks
Lightweight enhancements of existing skills, correcting oversights and making some skills more sensible and functional.
1. [Alchemical Knowledge](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49036)
1. [Locks and Traps Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48528?)
1. [Realistic Repair](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673?)
	- Do not enable the ESP file; the next mod integrates repair activators into the world
1. [Realistic Repair – Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47461)
	- Download and install the Main File
	- Download and install the Optional File, merging when prompted
		- Hide the **Realistic_Repair_Add-on - PFP Patch.esp**
1. [Silver Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086)

1. [Lua Lockbashing](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48544?)

1. [Magicka Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111?)
	- Enable the "00 - Framework," "01 - Resource Pack," and whichever spell packs you like. I prefer just the "lore friendly pack" but the other packs (particularly weather and cortex magic) are very fun to play with:

1. [Customizable MWSE Multi Mark and Limited Recall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47065?)

## Stealth Overhaul
Fixes the worst-implemented mechanics in the game, making thief/stealth characters fun and viable.
1. [Distraction](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49680)
1. [Pickpocket](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47581?)

1. [Regional Bounty](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47285?)

## Survival Mechanics
Optional module for Merlord's survival and camping mod, *Ashfall*, and a complementary suite of mods. This is easily the most impressive gameplay mod around. It's sleek, easy to use, and really, really fun. 
1. [Ashfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057?tab=description)
1. [The Guar Whisperer](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48247)
>*Note*: there is a very small performance hit. Depending on your machine, you may not notice.

## Sound Overhaul
Dynamic ambient sound, footsteps, and more.
1. [AURA](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48255?)
1. [Character Sound Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49654)
