# Gameplay - Expanded

## Player Levelling
Morrowind's levelling system shows its age. Because of how it handles skill-ups and attribute modifiers, Morrowind encourages micromanagement and powergaming, which is uNiMmERsiVE and BAD. There are several recent lua-based levelling overhauls that make skill increases/levelling much less intrusive.

Choose and **install only ONE** of the following levelling mod sections. If this is your first time with Morrowind, I recommend playing with **Improved Vanilla Levelling** (it most closely resembles the original game's system), and trying **Class-Conscious Character Progression (CCCP)** on a subsequent playthrough:

### Improved Vanilla
Install this section if you want to play with **Improved Vanilla**, which does as the name suggests: it cuts out the micromanagement and irons out kinks in the game's levelling system.
1. [Improved Vanilla Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48065?)
1. [Borrowed Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48971)
1. [Class Skill Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48989)
1. [Magicka Based Skill Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330?)
1. [MWSE Magicka Regen](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48129?)
1. [Proportional Progression](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- In MO2, set Proportional Progression as your data directory and install
1. [Proportional Progression config file](https://mega.nz/file/65IDlIyD#TNWRaOH9-PAilPD1NGH1hCxZzYUoL2OWGrMVstVA1Bk)
	- Enable only "01 - Improved Vanilla"
	- This custom config file enables the levelling scaling of Proportional Progression. Tweaked for **Improved Vanilla levelling** and **Class Skill Limit**.
	- This config adjusts skill gain speed per skill (slower magic, extremely slow athletics and acrobatics, slightly faster armorer and security skill gain); level specific (at low levels characters level skills faster, and then gradually slower as they level up); and skill-level specific (low-level skills level up faster, but rates slow down until the variable cap from Class Skill Limit).

### Class-Conscious Character Progression
Install this section if you want to play with **Class-Conscious Character Progression (CCCP)**. **CCCP** makes major changes to the game's levelling system, which I won't summarize here. Basically it is very, very good:
1. [Class-Conscious Character Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110?)
1. [Magicka Based Skill Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330?)
1. [Proportional Progression](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- In MO2, set Proportional Progression as your data directory and install
1. [Proportional Progression config file](In progress!)
	- This custom config file enables the levelling scaling of Proportional Progression. Tweaked for CCCP.
