# Gameplay - Expanded
The good stuff. This module introduces the majority of the gameplay mechanics and new features that cannot strictly be considered fixes or balance changes. As ever, this module remains faithful to the vanilla game's look and feel.

## Player Levelling
Morrowind's levelling system shows its age. Because of how it handles skill-ups and attribute modifiers, Morrowind encourages micromanagement and powergaming, which is uNiMmERsiVE and BAD. There are several recent lua-based levelling overhauls that make skill increases/levelling much less intrusive.

Choose and **install only ONE** of the following levelling mod sections. If this is your first time with Morrowind, I recommend playing with **Improved Vanilla Levelling** (it most closely resembles the original game's system), and trying **Class-Conscious Character Progression (CCCP)** on a subsequent playthrough:

### Improved Vanilla
Install this section if you want to play with **Improved Vanilla**, which does as the name suggests: it cuts out the micromanagement and irons out kinks in the game's levelling system.
1. [Improved Vanilla Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48065?)
1. [Class Skill Limit](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48989)
1. [Magicka Based Skill Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330?)
1. [MWSE Magicka Regen](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48129?)
1. [Proportional Progression](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- In MO2, set Proportional Progression as your data directory and install
1. [Proportional Progression config file](https://mega.nz/file/65IDlIyD#TNWRaOH9-PAilPD1NGH1hCxZzYUoL2OWGrMVstVA1Bk)
	- Enable only "01 - Improved Vanilla"
	- This custom config file enables the levelling scaling of Proportional Progression. Tweaked for **Improved Vanilla levelling** and **Class Skill Limit**.
	- This config adjusts skill gain speed per skill (slower magic, extremely slow athletics and acrobatics, slightly faster armorer and security skill gain); level specific (at low levels characters level skills faster, and then gradually slower as they level up); and skill-level specific (low-level skills level up faster, but rates slow down until the variable cap from Class Skill Limit).

### Class-Conscious Character Progression (section is WIP)
Install this section if you want to play with **Class-Conscious Character Progression (CCCP)**. **CCCP** makes major changes to the game's levelling system, which I won't summarize here. Basically it is very, very good:
1. [Class-Conscious Character Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110?)
1. [Magicka Based Skill Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330?)
1. [Proportional Progression](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- In MO2, set Proportional Progression as your data directory and install
1. [Proportional Progression config file](In progress!)
	- This custom config file enables the levelling scaling of Proportional Progression. Tweaked for CCCP.

## Skill Tweaks
Lightweight enhancements of existing skills, correcting oversights and making the Alchemy, Armorer, Security, and Speech skills more sensible and functional.
1. [Alchemical Knowledge](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49036)
1. [Locks and Traps Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48528?)

1. [Realistic Repair](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46673?)

1. [Realistic Repair – Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47461)
	- Download and install the Main File
	- *Compatibility patch*: download [Realistic Repair - Add-on PFP Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49471?) and install as a separate mod, loading the plugin after "Realistic_Repair_Add-on.esp"
1. [Silver Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49086)

1. [Poison Crafting](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729?)
	- Disable the "MWSE" folder
	- Cleaning: ESP requires cleaning
1. [Poison Redux-ion](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48948)
1. [Sneaky Strike](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48317)

## Expanded Magic
The Magicka Expanded framework significantly enhances magic use via MWSE. New and better spells, new and better effects, all seamlessly integrated into the game.
1. [Magicka Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47111?)
	- Enable the "00 - Framework," "01 - Resource Pack," and whichever spell packs you like. I prefer just the "lore friendly pack" but the other packs (particularly weather and cortex magic) are very fun to play with:
		- 00 - Framework
		- 01 - Resource Pack
		- 02 - Lore Friendly Package
1. [Enhanced Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47480?)
	- Enable the following BAIN options
		- 00 - Core
		- 01 - Cast VFX
1. [Enhanced Detection Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48471?)
	- Installation instructions: enable only the "Enhanced Detection Less Lite" option
1. [Enhanced Invisibility](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47565?)
1. [Enhanced Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47672?)
	- Enable the following BAIN options:
		- 00 - Core
1. [Enhanced Reflection](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48956)
1. [Enhanced Telekinesis](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47534?)

		- 00 - Core
		- 01 - Cast VFX

1. [Customizable MWSE Multi Mark and Limited Recall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47065?)

## Crime, Combat, and Character Tweaks
Further tweaks to the character creation and crime systems.
1. [Clear Your Name](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43786?)
1. [The Last Witness](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Download the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- In MO2, set The Last Witness as your data directory and install
1. [The Law is Sacred](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48130?)
	- ESP is optional (it changes a dialogue line to reflect guards' new non-lethal arrest tactics); you can leave it disabled
1. [Personal Effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45338?)
	- Enable only the "Personal Effects_MWSE.ESP"
1. [Regional Bounty](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47285?)

## Survival Mechanics
Optional module for Merlord's survival and camping mod, *Ashfall*, and a complementary suite of mods. This is easily the most impressive gameplay mod around. It's sleek, easy to use, and really, really fun. 

Where many survival mechanics opt for tedium and punish players (and sometimes I enjoy that!), *Ashfall* is really relaxed. It is also highly customizable through its MCM, allowing you to tweak and disable all its features on the fly. Strongly recommended for returning players.

Note: There is a very small performance hit. Depending on your overall performance, you may not notice.
1. [Skills Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034)
1. [Ashfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057?tab=description)
1. [The Guar Whisperer](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48247)

## Dynamic Environmental FX
These mods complement the lighting and weather changes from the Visuals section:  light scheduling, dynamic ambient sound, more dynamic weather, and region-specific environmental events.
1. [AURA](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48255?)
1. [Heartthrum](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47178)
	- ESP requires cleaning
1. [The Midnight Oil](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48293?)
	- ESP requires cleaning
1. [Shattered Stones - An Earthquake Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45105?)
	- Earthquakes occur too frequently with default settings:
		- When in-game, open the console (~) and type: ```set fQuakeChance to 10```
	- Cleaning: ESP requires cleaning
1. [Watch the Skies](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48636)
	- Enable: "00 Lua core" and "02 Weather Adjuster Replacer"
