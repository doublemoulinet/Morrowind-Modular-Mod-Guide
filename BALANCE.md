## Levelling and Skills
Morrowind's levelling system shows its age. Because of how it handles skill-ups and attribute modifiers, Morrowind encourages powergaming, which is uNiMmERsiVE and BAD. There are several recent lua-based levelling overhauls that make skill increases/levelling much less intrusive.

Choose and **install only ONE** of the following levelling mod sections. If this is your first time with Morrowind, I recommend playing with Improved Vanilla Levelling first (it most closely resembles the original game's system), and trying CCCP on a subsequent playthrough:

### Improved Vanilla 
Install this section if you want to play with Improved Vanilla. 
1. [Improved Vanilla Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48065?tab=files)
1. [Beast Race Abilities Toggleable](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44948?tab=files)
	- You can skip this if you won't be playing as a Lizard or a Cat.
1. [Dynamic Difficulty](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- Unzip, selected Dynamic Difficulty and install
1. [Magicka Based Skill Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48330?tab=files)
1. [MWSE Magicka Regen](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48129?tab=files)
1. [Proportional Progression](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- Unzip, selected Proportional Progression and install
1. [Proportional Progression config file](COMING SOON)
	- This custom config file enables the levelling scaling of Proportional Progression. Tweaked for Vanilla/Improved Vanilla levelling. Unpack to a project and experiment with the values!
1. [Putting Power in Willpower](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45742?tab=files)
1. [Wings of Will](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46626?tab=files)

### Class-Conscious Character Progression
Install this section if you want to play with Class-Conscious Character Progression (CCCP). CCCP makes major changes to the game's levelling system, making skill-ups and attribute gains more intuitive and extensive. It also includes significant changes to the level progression and rate of skill gain. Basically it is very good:
