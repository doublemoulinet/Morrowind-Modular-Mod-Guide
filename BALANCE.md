## Anti-Cheese

	- Download and install "Better Balanced Booze" main file
1. [Controlled Consumption](https://github.com/NullCascade/morrowind-mods)
	- Click “Clone or download” the zip of all NullCascade’s Morrowind mods
	- Unzip, select Controlled Consumption and install

1. [Ownership Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48051?tab=files)
	- This mod overwrites some changes to Anthology Solstheim / Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince (which moves the island of Solstheim farther north). You will need to delete the exterior Solstheim cell references with TESAME (or suffer floating objects in the middle of the sea)
	- The cell edits you need to delete in TESAME are:
		1. Felsaad Coast Region (This Cell is unnamed; it will be the penultimate unnamed entry if listed alphabetically)
		1. Isinfer Plains Region (This Cell is unnamed; it will be the last unnamed entry if listed alphabetically)
		1. Fort Frostmoth
		1. Fort Frostmoth
		1. Raven Rock
		1. Skaal Village
		1. Skaal Village
		1. Thirsk
	- Delete these *and only* these cells in TESAME. Remember to save the plugin before exiting TESAME
	- I recommend zipping the edited ESP and installing as a new mod to avoid accidentally overwriting it

1. [There Can Be Only One](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47766?tab=files)

	- Download and install the Optional File "Urnest Loot"	
	
## Levelling and Skills
Morrowind's levelling system shows its age. Because of how it handles skill-ups and attribute modifiers, Morrowind encourages powergaming, which is uNiMmERsiVE and BAD. There are several recent lua-based levelling overhauls that make skill increases/levelling much less intrusive.

Choose and **install only ONE** of the following levelling mods. I recommend playing with Improved Vanilla Levelling first (it most closely resembles the original game's system), and trying MULE or CCCP on a subsequent playthrough:

1. [Improved Vanilla Leveling](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48065?tab=files)
1. [Mort's Ultimate Leveling Experience - MULE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47452?tab=files)
1. [Class-Conscious Character Progression](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110?tab=files)
