# Visuals

## Texture Base
1. [Intelligent Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469?)
	- The definitive texture replacer for Morrowind. Highly recommended.
	- Install both the Main File and the "Wood Fix 2.1b" Update File
	- Enable both "00 Core" and "01 Atlas Textures"

## Grass
1. [Remiros' Groundcover](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46733?)
	- The definitive groundcover/grass mod for Morrowind. Highly recommended. No performance impact on my setup (GTX 1070 Ti), though performance may vary depending on your GPU.
	- Installation: enable the "00 Core" option
	- Note: the plugins will only be enabled during MGE XE's distant land generation, which you will run at the end of the guide in the [**Finish Line**](https://github.com/doublemoulinet/Morrowind-Modular-Mod-Guide/blob/master/FINISHLINE.md) section. 
	- If you want to be a real nerd about it, you can repackage the mod with the grass plugins in a separate folder within "Data Files" (ex., \Data Files\Grass Plugins). You can then specify this as an additional directory in the MGE XE distant land generator
	- Otherwise, the plugins should not be enabled in your load order, and after distant land generation can be disabled in the Installers Tab. Again, the **ESPs should be disabled except when regenerating distant land**
