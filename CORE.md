# Core
The following are all you need to play the game on modern systems. This section and [Setup](https://github.com/doublemoulinet/Morrowind-Modular-Mod-Guide/blob/master/SETUP.md) are the only required sections of the guide. The patches section fixes most of the game's bugs, and MOP and Project Atlas dramatically increase performance.

## Patches

1. [Expansion Delay](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47588?)
