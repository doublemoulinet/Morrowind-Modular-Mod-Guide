# Optional Early Loaders
These optional mods should not be used on your first playthrough, with the exception of the **Vanilla Uncompressed Textures**. The **Official Plugins** are of variable quality--some are great, others are trivial, some are best forgotten. The cleaned and fixed versions presented here are the best way to incorporate them into your game, but are not necessary for an enjoyable Morrowind experience. 

The landmass mods--Tamriel Rebuilt and its sister projects--are highly recommended on subsequent playthroughs. These are arguably the most impressive modding projects on the web. Tamriel Rebuilt is a decades-long project to recreate the Morrowind mainland in TES3. The "Old Ebonheart" release is one of the best quest mods available and I recommend a TR-centric playthrough to play the different questlines.

Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince overhauls the Bloodmoon expansion to bring the world design in line with current Tamriel Rebuilt / Project Tamriel design standards. It is highly recommended. You will see why after you play Bloodmoon in vanilla: the vanilla world design is flat, empty, and boring. STOTSP is a performance-friendly overhaul that makes playing Bloodmoon significantly more fun.

I recommend installing these mods anyway **but not enabling them in the Installers tab** on your first playthrough.
