# Introduction

**IMPORTANT NOTE: This guide is not being actively maintained. Consider it out of date... for now. (January 2022).**

This is my personal mod list for Morrowind, with an emphasis on performance and preserving vanilla aesthetics. This is the result of years of messing around, learning the tools, and curating mods that don't suck but actually rule, man.

For the definitive setup and mod guide, see Sigourn's [Morrowind Improved](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-improved). Beginners might also consult Danae's [Morrowind First Time](http://danaeplays.thenet.sk/morrowind-first-time/) guide. Some of the structure of this guide (particularly the setup section) has been adapted from Sigourn's.

This guide's selling features:
- Step-by-step instructions in a **fully modular format**--including essential, visual, balance, and quality-of-life mods.
- A curated selection of **vanilla-friendly gameplay and content mods**, including new and enhanced skills, settlement and dungeon expansions, new items, and quests.
- Step-by-step instructions for installing the province mods, **Tamriel Rebuilt**, **Skyrim: Home of the Nords**, and **Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince**. 

## Using this Guide and Installing Mods
The guide is modular, meaning you can install most sections incrementally. Many of the mods in this guide can be skipped without causing mod compatibility/dependency problems. A first-time player need only follow the instructions in the first sections to have a stable, playable game. However, all sections are designed with a vanilla-friendly experience in mind. I recommend first-time players skip the "**CONTENT**"  section.

This list does not typically describe what each mod does. Read the description on the mod page, and always read the readme.

## Note on performance
Morrowind is a single-core application, meaning CPU load is the major performance bottleneck. A CPU with fast single-core processing speed is the key to good performance. This guide tries to keep the CPU load low, so that a range of moderate systems will get stable framerates.

On moderate desktop hardware (ex., an i7-3770 and GTX 680), you should be able to get a stable **50-60FPS in-game**.
